pareto.uidfixer Package Readme
==============================

Overview
--------

This package finds relative hrefs and img src locations in HTML fields, and
replaces then with resolveuid ones. It can also rewrite faulty existing
resolveuid links. Both rewrites can be turned on as options and a dry run is
available to detect changed links throughout your site.
